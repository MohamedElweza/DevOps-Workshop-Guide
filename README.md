# DevOps Workshop Project Guide

This document is a complete and simple guide to help you set up and understand the full DevOps workflow we applied in the workshop. Itâ€™s designed for anyone who wants to replicate the projects from scratch and gain hands-on experience with modern DevOps tools.

## Overview
We deployed a **multi-tier Java web application** with the following services:
- **Tomcat (App Server)**
- **MySQL (Database)**
- **Memcached (Caching)**
- **RabbitMQ (Message Broker)**
- **Nginx (Reverse Proxy)**

Each project built on the one before it, moving from manual deployment to full CI/CD in the cloud using Infrastructure as Code.

---

## Project 1: Manual Deployment On-Premises
**Tools:** Vagrant + VirtualBox + Manual Configuration  
**What We Did:**
- Created 5 separate VMs using Vagrant.
- Manually installed and configured MySQL, RabbitMQ, Tomcat, Memcached, and Nginx.
- Connected services to form a working architecture.

**GitHub Repo:** [Multi-Tier Java Web Application](https://github.com/MohamedElweza/Multi-Tier-Java-Web-Application)

---

## Project 2: Automated Deployment with Shell Scripts
**Tools:** Vagrant + Bash Scripts  
**What We Did:**
- Created scripts to automatically install and configure each service.
- Provisioned machines using `vagrant up`.
- Made the setup reproducible and consistent.

**Directory:** `Bash Scripts/`

---

## Project 3: On-Premises Automation with Ansible
**Tools:** Vagrant + Ansible + Roles  
**What We Did:**
- Used Ansible to replace manual scripting.
- Created reusable roles for each service.
- Defined inventory and site playbook for orchestration.

**GitHub Repo:** [Ansible Deployment Repo](https://github.com/MohamedElweza/Automating-Multi-Tier-Java-Web-Application-Deployment-with-Ansible)

---

## Project 4a: AWS EC2 Deployment (Manual Setup)
**Tools:** AWS Console + AWS CLI  
**What We Did:**
- Launched EC2 instances for each service.
- Installed and configured each service with scripts.
- Defined security groups for isolated and secure communication between services.
- Deployed the Java app and connected it with RabbitMQ, Memcached, and MySQL manually.

**Directory:** `AWS Scripts/`

---

## Project 4b: AWS Native Services Deployment
**Tools:** AWS Console + AWS Services  
**What We Did:**
- Replaced VMs with AWS managed services:
  - **Amazon RDS** for MySQL
  - **ElastiCache** for Memcached
  - **Amazon MQ** for RabbitMQ
  - **Elastic Beanstalk / ECS** for app deployment
- Configured IAM, networking, and security groups.
- Used automation scripts to connect all services together.

---

## Project 5: Containerization with Docker
**Tools:** Docker + Docker Compose  
**What We Did:**
- Containerized all services including the Java application, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Memcached, and Nginx.
- Created Dockerfiles and a `docker-compose.yml` to spin up the entire stack locally with one command.
- Enabled easy testing and development with isolated containers.

**Directory:** `Docker Files/`

---

## Project 6: Kubernetes Deployment
**Tools:** Docker + Kubernetes + kubectl  
**What We Did:**
- Wrote YAML files to deploy all components:
  - Deployments & Services for MySQL, RabbitMQ, Memcached, and the App
  - Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data
  - LoadBalancer and NodePort for external access
- Ensured dependencies readiness using initContainers.

**GitHub Repo:** [K8s Multi-Tier App](https://github.com/MohamedElweza/K8s-MultiTier-App)

---

## Project 7: CI/CD with Jenkins & ArgoCD
**Tools:** Jenkins + ArgoCD + GitHub  
**What We Did:**
- Used Jenkins to build Docker images and push them to registry.
- Configured pipelines to trigger on code updates.
- Installed ArgoCD on Kubernetes and connected it to GitHub repo.
- Enabled GitOps-based deployment via ArgoCD.

> **Best Practice:** Jenkins handles build, ArgoCD handles deployment.

**GitHub Repo:** [CI/CD with Jenkins & ArgoCD](https://github.com/MohamedElweza/CI-CD-with-Jenkins-ArgoCD-for-Kubernetes-Deployment)

---

## Project 8: Terraform for AWS Deployment
**Tools:** Terraform  
**What We Did:**
- Wrote `.tf` files to define complete infrastructure (VPC, subnets, EC2, RDS, security groups).
- Used remote-exec and user data to automate configuration.
- Reproducible, version-controlled, and scalable deployment.

**Directory:** `Terraform files/`

---

## Project 9: Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana
**Tools:** Prometheus + Grafana + Node Exporter  
**What We Did:**
- Installed and configured Prometheus to scrape metrics from services.
- Used Node Exporter and other exporters to monitor system and app metrics.
- Deployed Grafana dashboards to visualize the health and performance of the system.
- Integrated with Kubernetes and Docker where applicable.
**Directory:** `Monitoring/`
---

## Resources & Notes
- Minimum Recommended: **4 CPU / 8 GB RAM** (especially for Jenkins, ArgoCD, Kubernetes)
- Use least-privilege **security groups** in AWS
- Add `k8s/` to `.gitignore` in CI/CD repo to avoid duplicate uploads
- Every project is modular and builds on the one before it
- Each project has its own GitHub repo or script directory for easy setup

## Final Words
This workshop gave us a complete DevOps learning experienceâ€”from manual setups to fully automated CI/CD pipelines in the cloud. Feel free to build on top of these projects by adding monitoring, observability, or Helm chart management. ðŸ’¡ðŸš€
